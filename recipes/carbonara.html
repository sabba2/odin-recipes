        <h1>Fettucine Carbonara Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../img/carbonara.jpg" alt="fettucine carbonara">

        <p>Carbonara is a Roman pasta dish made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork and black pepper. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century.</p>

        <p>The cheese is usually Pecorina Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Normally guanciale or pancetta are used for the meat component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</p>

        <p>This fettuccine carbonara recipe is a <em>delectable,</em> mouth-watering pile of yummy goodness! I recommend a nice salad with it — that's all you will need for a complete meal.</p>
