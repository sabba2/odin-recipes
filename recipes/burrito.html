    <p>A burrito is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that took form in Ciudad Ju√°rez, consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served "wet", i.e., covered in a savory and spicy sauce, when they would be eaten with a fork and knife.</p>

    <p> Here we have an everyday Beef Burrito recipe, stuffed with a <em>simple</em>, <strong>super tasty seasoned beef,</strong> rice and other fillings of choice. These Burritos are a <strong>brilliant freezer standby</strong> because they are just as good made fresh or frozen then reheated. The burrito beef filling is especially good - made with a homemade Mexican seasoning that's way better than a packet of Old El Paso! </p>
