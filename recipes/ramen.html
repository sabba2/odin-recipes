    <p>
      Ramen s a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles
      served in a broth; common flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical
      toppings including sliced pork hāshū, nori (dried seaweed), menma (bamboo
      shoots), and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes.
      Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the
      tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido.
